Keep your subworkflows out of your workflows, so you can reuse them.

*lavor√©tto* (Italian for "work of little importance or of little effort") is a tiny tool useful when working with Google Cloud Platform [Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows). Here is how it works:

1. Write your workflows YAML files **without including any subworkflow** in them.
2. Write your subworkflows in their own directory (e.g. `src/subworkflows`), each subworkflow in its own separate file.
3. Tell lavoretto which workflow you want to build, and where to get the subworkflows.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev lavoretto
```

## Usage

Build a single workflow:

```sh
lavoretto \
  -i path/to/your/workflow-file \
  --subworkflows path/to/your/subworkflows-directory
```

Build all workflows found in a (possibly nested) directory:

```sh
lavoretto \
  -i path/to/your/workflows-directory \
  --subworkflows path/to/your/subworkflows-directory
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | `src/workflows` | Path to the workflow file/directory to build. |
| `subworkflows` | `src/subworkflows` | Path to the subworkflow directory. |
| `outdir` | `dist` | Directory where this tool will put the generated workflows. |
| `header` | `true` | Whether to include a comment at the beginning of each generated workflow. Use `--no-header` if you don't want it. |
| `footer` | `false` | Whether to include a comment at the bottom of each generated workflow. |

See a few more examples in [scripts](./scripts/README.md).

## Troubleshoot

This tool uses [debug](https://github.com/debug-js/debug) for its logs. You can set the environment variable `DEBUG=lavoretto:*` to troubleshoot this tool.
